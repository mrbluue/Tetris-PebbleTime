# Tetris-PebbleTime

This is a fork of [WRansohoff's original project](https://github.com/WRansohoff/Tetris-PebbleTime/).
Modifications were made starting in 2025 by mrbluue.

Fork of *Definitely Not Tetris* for the Pebble Time watch, with now added support for Pebble Time Round, and ready to be easily updated for the release of the Core Time 2. 
I just got a Pebble Time Round for fun, and I was sad there was no game like this for it, so I adapted this one. I haven't changed or upgraded anything about the logic of the game itself so far, but I would love to get around to it. Below is my wishlist for that.

Plans for future:
- Some UI improvements
- Add a delay before a block is set to allow for more movement leeway, to be a little closer to the game as we know it 
- Staying pressed on Up or Down to move the block left or right continuously, instead of moving it to the max position in one go (which I found annoying and removed in this version.)
- Better score system
- Animation when scoring 4 lines, and when levelling up
- Will attempt to add a held block, so you can switch between the current piece by a simple press on Select. (Pausing the game would require a long press.)
- *(and maybe remove all mentions of the Tetris trademark, but I'm sure it'll be fine!)*
