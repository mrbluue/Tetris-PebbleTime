# Tetris-PebbleTime
## Original README by WRansohoff:
Tetris for the Pebble Time watch.

I saw that there were some tetris apps available for the Pebble in black and white, and thought it would be nice to have a color version for the Pebble Time.

It's pretty basic, but supports loading interrupted games, pausing, scoring, and levels. It's Tetris, you know the drill.

## Message from MrBlue:
I am a big fan of having this game on my wrist, so I needed to update it to add stuff I felt was missing for the revival of Pebble:
- Added support for Pebble Time Round.
- New main menu (not final.)
- Staying pressed on Up or Down to move the block left or right continuously.
- Added a basic scoring system with a high score window.
- Added basic settings and themes (themes are WIP.)
There are still quite a few things to refine, and a couple things I want to add:
- Lock delay, so that you can move the piece for some time before it locks down.
- Flash or animation, anything to indicate when you get 4 lines.
- Support for Pebble Time 2, with maybe touch screen input for a hold piece?
- Maybe support for B&W screen Pebble 2 Duo? Not a priority.
