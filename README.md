# Tetris-PebbleTime
Tetris for the Pebble Time watch.

I saw that there were some tetris apps available for the Pebble in black and white, and thought it would be nice to have a color version for the Pebble Time.

It's pretty basic, but supports loading interrupted games, pausing, scoring, and levels. It's Tetris, you know the drill.

Added in v1.4 by mrbluue:
- Added support for Pebble Time Round
- UI tweaks to allow it to port easily to different sized screens, in preparation for the Core Time 2.

Message from mrbluue:
I just got a Pebble Time Round for fun, and I was sad there was no Tetris for it as it is on of my favorite games and a good memory from the last time I had a Pebble. So I decided to adapt this one. 
I haven't changed or upgraded anything about the logic of the game itself so far, but I would love to get around to it. Below is my wishlist for that:
- Adding a delay before a shape settles when moving it to give more leeway and make endgame less punishing
- Staying pressed on Up or Down to move the block left or right continuously, one block by one block, instead of moving it to the max position in one go (which I found annoying and deactivated in this version.)
- Adding a basic scoring system like on the NES
- Flash when clearing 4 lines, and when levelling up
- Maybe a held block with the Back button? (Pausing the game would require a long press.)
